<p>Lexend is a variable typeface designed by Thomas Jockin for the non-profit RevReading in 2018. Applying the Shaver-Troup Individually Optimal Text Formation Factors, studies have found readers instantaneously improve their reading fluency. This font is based on the Quicksand project from Andrew Paglinawan in 2008. Quicksand was improved in 2016 by Thomas Jockin for the Google Font Improvement Project and selected to be the base for the specialized task of improving reading fluency in low-proficiency readers. This includes readers with dyslexia. </p>
